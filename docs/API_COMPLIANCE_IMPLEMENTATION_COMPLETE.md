- All limits strictly enforced
- No tolerance for violations
- Immediate blocking on limit breach
- Maximum compliance assurance

### MODERATE (Default)
- Most limits enforced with some flexibility
- Grace period for minor violations
- Balanced performance and compliance
- Recommended for production use

### LENIENT

## üöÄ How to Use

### Quick Start
```python
# Import compliance utilities
from compliance_breeze_utils import ComplianceBreezeDataManager
from compliance_yahoo_utils import ComplianceYahooFinanceManager

# Initialize with compliance
breeze_manager = ComplianceBreezeDataManager()
yahoo_manager = ComplianceYahooFinanceManager()

# Use exactly like before - compliance is automatic!
quotes = breeze_manager.get_quotes_safe("TCS", "NSE")
data = yahoo_manager.download_symbol_data("AAPL", period="1mo")
```

### Enhanced Integration
```python
# Existing code works unchanged
from enhanced_breeze_utils import EnhancedBreezeDataManager

# Compliance monitoring is automatically added
manager = EnhancedBreezeDataManager()
response = manager.get_historical_data_safe(request)
# ‚úÖ Rate limiting and compliance monitoring active
```

### Custom Compliance Levels
```python
from api_compliance import ComplianceLevel

# Choose enforcement level
manager = ComplianceBreezeDataManager(
    compliance_level=ComplianceLevel.STRICT
)
```
